This agent-based model simulates the influence of spatial constraints on network formation, and on several transmission processes along the network. 
N agents with communication range r randomly move through a coordinate grid gxg, dynamically add and remove links based on communication range, 
and with some global probability P diffuse information along these links.

The folder contains 3 python files: one for the agent update rules, one for running the simulation, and one for creating plots and summary statistics from simulation results.
